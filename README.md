# Food-recommandation-system
Machine learning based recommandation system (in progress).
I'm doing this project to apply what I'm learning though this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models/).

## Quickstart
We are in research phase. So just install virtual env, update dependencies & continue to search.
```
python -m venv auth
source auth/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
